# plantuml-little

[中文](README.zh.md) | English

A lightweight Rust reimplementation of [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), targeting byte-exact SVG output parity with Java PlantUML **v1.2026.2**.

## What Is This

plantuml-little takes `.puml` source text and produces `.svg` output — the same as Java PlantUML, but as a native Rust library + CLI with zero JVM dependency. The goal is **identical SVG output** for all supported diagram types, verified by 337 byte-exact reference tests against the upstream Java release.

## Alignment Status

| | |
|---|---|
| **Upstream version** | PlantUML v1.2026.2 (`bb8550d`) |
| **Reference tests** | 337 passed / 0 pinned-baseline / 3 ignored (see `tests/known_failures.txt`) |
| **Unit tests** | 2,693 |
| **Integration tests** | 185 |
| **Total tests** | **3,215** |

### Test Methodology

Reference tests compare the SVG plantuml-little emits against an upstream-generated reference for every fixture under `tests/fixtures/`. To keep that comparison truly byte-exact across platforms we pin two shared axes:

- **Shared-wasm Graphviz.** Both the Java reference pipeline and plantuml-little's Rust layout code route `dot` calls through [`@actrium/graphviz-anywhere-web`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actrium/graphviz-anywhere-web) (Graphviz 14.1.5 + libexpat, compiled to wasm). The Java side uses the `scripts/wasm-dot-wrapper.sh` shim as `GRAPHVIZ_DOT`; the Rust side opts in via `PLANTUML_LITTLE_TEST_BACKEND=wasm`. Graphviz output is therefore bit-identical on every machine.
- **DejaVu Sans fonts.** plantuml-little bakes DejaVu Sans / DejaVu Sans Mono text-width metrics into `src/font_data.rs` — including the matching `*-Oblique` italic faces so `«stereotype»`-style strings measure exactly as Java does on a system with `fonts-dejavu-extra` installed. Reference SVGs are regenerated on Ubuntu (via the manual `regenerate-refs.yml` workflow) where Java's `sans-serif` resolves to DejaVu through fontconfig, so `textLength` values compare byte-exact.

Two Graphviz execution modes are supported:

- `native` (default): links against [`graphviz-anywhere`](https://github.com/Actrium/graphviz-anywhere)'s prebuilt `libgraphviz_api` — fast, no Node required; recommended for `cargo test --lib` / day-to-day development.
- `wasm` (opt-in via `PLANTUML_LITTLE_TEST_BACKEND=wasm`): spawns the same Node/wasm runner the Java reference pipeline uses; this is what CI runs for `test-reference` to guarantee cross-platform determinism.

> **Font prerequisite for the `native` backend on non-Linux hosts.** The native Graphviz build measures real text through pango/fontconfig, so the reference baselines only reproduce byte-exact on a machine where fontconfig resolves `DejaVu Sans` to the same font the baselines were generated with. A fresh macOS has no DejaVu installed, so fontconfig silently falls back to a system face (e.g. Hiragino Sans) — that shifts `textLength` and layout coordinates by a pixel or two and the reference tests fail even though nothing is wrong with the code. Install DejaVu before running the native reference suite:
>
> ```sh
> brew install --cask font-dejavu   # macOS; Linux: apt install fonts-dejavu-core
> fc-cache -f
> fc-match "DejaVu Sans"            # must report DejaVuSans.ttf, not a system fallback
> ```
>
> CI sidesteps this entirely by running the `wasm` backend, whose font metrics are baked into `src/font_data.rs` and host-independent.

See `tests/reference/VERSION` for the exact jar / JDK / Graphviz / font-stack snapshot the current baseline was produced against.

## Supported Diagram Types (29)

All types below produce SVG output byte-exactly matching Java PlantUML v1.2026.2.

| Type | Start Tag | Layout Engine |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Class | `@startuml` | Graphviz (Smetana) |
| Sequence | `@startuml` | Built-in (Puma / Teoz) |
| Activity v3 | `@startuml` | Built-in |
| State | `@startuml` | Graphviz |
| Component / Deployment | `@startuml` | Graphviz |
| Use Case | `@startuml` | Graphviz |
| Object | `@startuml` | Graphviz |
| Timing | `@startuml` | Built-in |
| ERD (Chen) | `@startchen` | Graphviz |
| Gantt | `@startgantt` | Built-in |
| JSON | `@startjson` | Built-in |
| YAML | `@startyaml` | Built-in |
| Mindmap | `@startmindmap` | Built-in |
| WBS | `@startwbs` | Built-in |
| NWDiag | `@startnwdiag` | Built-in |
| Salt / Wireframe | `@startsalt` | Built-in |

| Regex | `@startregex` | Built-in |
| BPM | `@startbpm` | Built-in |
| Board | `@startboard` | Built-in |

| Pie | `@startpie` | Built-in |
| HCL | `@starthcl` | Built-in |
| Flow | `@startflow` | Built-in |
| Wire | `@startwire` | Built-in |
| Archimate | `@startuml` | Graphviz |
| Packet | `@startpacket` | Built-in |

### Additional Types (text / passthrough)

| Type | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Creole | `@startcreole` — rich text markup rendering |
| Def | `@startdef` — plain text display |
| Math / LaTeX | `@startmath` / `@startlatex` — formula placeholder (Java requires external tools) |
| Git | `@startgit` — git log visualization |
| Files | `@startfiles` — file tree display |

### Intentionally Unsupported

| Type | Reason |
|------|--------|
| DITAA | Java delegates to a third-party rasterizer (no SVG mode). Implementing ASCII art → SVG from scratch is out of scope. |
| JCCKIT | Java AWT charting library, renders to `Graphics2D` only. No Rust equivalent. |
| Project (Gantt v2) | Java stable v1.2026.2 itself does not render this type. |

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.82+
- [`graphviz-anywhere`](https://github.com/Actrium/graphviz-anywhere) prebuilt native lib (fetched automatically in CI; locally point `GRAPHVIZ_ANYWHERE_DIR` at an extracted release tarball)
- For the wasm test backend (`PLANTUML_LITTLE_TEST_BACKEND=wasm`): Node 22+ and `cd tests/support && npm install`
- For regenerating reference SVGs locally: JDK 21+, DejaVu Sans fonts (`apt install fonts-dejavu-core` on Linux), and a `plantuml-1.2026.2.jar` — or use the `regenerate-refs.yml` workflow which sets all of that up on `ubuntu-latest`

## Non-Goals

- GUI, web server, FTP, pipe mode
- Output formats other than SVG (no PNG / PDF / EPS / ASCII)
- PlantUML Server URL encoding/decoding
- ELK layout engine
- Security sandbox
