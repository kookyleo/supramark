//! Host-side text-measurement callback bridge.
//!
//! When the wasm module runs inside a browser or React Native host
//! that already has a real text renderer, the cleanest way to keep
//! Layer 1 (in-wasm layout) consistent with Layer 3 (browser /
//! RN-svg actual rendering) is to defer measurement to the host.
//! The host injects a callback (e.g. wrapping
//! `canvas.getContext('2d').measureText` or
//! `react-native-skia.Skia.Text.Measure`) at module init via
//! wasm-bindgen externs; this struct adapts those externs to the
//! [`crate::Metrics`] trait.
//!
//! # Host contract
//!
//! The host is expected to install, before any wasm rendering call:
//!
//! ```js
//! globalThis.supramark = {
//!   measureText: (family, text, size, bold) => ({
//!     width:   /* number */,
//!     ascent:  /* number, optional */,
//!     descent: /* number, optional */,
//!   })
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! Italic isn't passed because canvas/Skia bridges typically lump
//! italic with style strings; we'll add it later if needed. If the
//! bridge isn't installed (or throws), every measurement falls back
//! to a `size * 0.6`-per-char heuristic — downstream code should
//! treat unusually round numbers as a hint that the host bridge
//! wasn't wired up rather than a real measurement.
