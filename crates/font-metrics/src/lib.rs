//! Font metrics abstraction for the `*-little` family of port crates.
//!
//! # Why a trait
//!
//! plantuml-little / mermaid-little / d2-little all need to know
//! "given this string + this font + this size, how wide is the
//! resulting rendered text?" to lay out SVG diagrams. There are
//! three legitimate ways to answer that, and they belong on
//! different code paths:
//!
//! 1. **`TtfParserMetrics`** — parse a caller-supplied TTF buffer
//!    with `ttf-parser` and compute glyph advances at runtime. The
//!    production main path on native / SSR / wasm hosts that have no
//!    text-measurement bridge.
//!
//! 2. **`HostCallbackMetrics`** — defer measurement to a JS-side
//!    callback (e.g. `canvas.measureText` in browsers, RN-Skia
//!    `SkiaText.measureText` on React Native). The production main
//!    path inside a wasm host that has a real text renderer:
//!    measuring with the very font the host will render with
//!    eliminates Layer 1 / Layer 3 drift that no static table can
//!    fix.
//!
//! 3. **`StaticDejaVuMetrics`** (feature `static-fixtures`) —
//!    pre-computed range tables that match Java FontMetrics on
//!    DejaVu Sans / Mono / Serif byte-exactly. Used **only** by the
//!    upstream-byte-equal regression tests in plantuml-little and
//!    mermaid-little to verify the port still matches Java's output.
//!    Production code should not depend on it; the Java-flavoured
//!    numbers diverge from any browser's actual rendering anyway.
//!
//! # Layer 1 / 2 / 3 architecture (for context)
//!
//! - **Layer 1**: in-wasm layout (this crate). Needs metrics to
//!   compute box sizes, line wrap, alignment.
//! - **Layer 2**: emitted SVG, with `font-family="..."` strings.
//! - **Layer 3**: host renderer (browser, RN-svg, ImageMagick) that
//!   actually rasterises the SVG, using whatever font the host's OS
//!   has installed.
//!
//! `TtfParserMetrics` and `HostCallbackMetrics` solve the same
//! problem from opposite ends: the former lets layer 1 use a known
//! font that we ship; the latter lets layer 1 ask layer 3 directly.
//! Pick the one that matches your host environment.
//!
//! See `docs/architecture/SHARED_FONT_METRICS.md` (TODO) for the
//! full design rationale.
